## About

**GunFlame Gigantic Trigger: Maximum Impact** is my first attempt at creating a video game. Itâ€™s a 2D space shooter inspired by classics like the R-Type series. The main goal of this project was to showcase my understanding of C# programming, Unity development, core mechanic implementation, and game design.

## Workshop

The game was intended to feature a system where players earn credits by completing missions, which can then be used to purchase new weapons and customize their ship.

## Challenges

As my first video game project, I significantly underestimated the scope of the planned features and mechanics. This led to some features and content being poorly implemented or removed altogether.

## Assets

The game utilizes third-party assets for models and sound effects, while the music was composed and recorded by me.
